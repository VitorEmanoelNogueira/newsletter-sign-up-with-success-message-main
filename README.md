## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup;
- OOCSS, BEM, SMACSS, namespaces;
- CSS custom properties;
- Flexbox;
- Mobile-first workflow.

### What I learned

- How to handle background-images efficiently with wrappers and aspect ratio;
- The distinction between layout, components, and objects in HTML & CSS architecture;
- How to manage components states more effectively using JS;
- How to write more organized and maintainable RegEx;
- How to make the layout more responsive in big screens with font-size in a simpler way.

### Continued development

- Plan and analyze the project upfront to reduce mental blocks;
- Reapply these lessons in future projects to work more efficiently;
- Deepen understanding of CSS namespaces and class architecture;
- Improve knowledge of JS form validation patterns.
